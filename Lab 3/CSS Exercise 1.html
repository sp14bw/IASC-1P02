<h1 id="firstHeader">The Beatles</h1>



<p class="paragraph">The Beatles were a legendary rock group that formed in Liverpool, England, in 1960, and went on to transform popular music as a creative,
  highly commercial art form over the next decade. The Beatles were one of the most popular bands of all time, producing songs like Yesterday,
  Hey Jude, Penny Lane, With A Little Help From My Friends, Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown), Day Tripper and Come Together.

  <p class="paragraph">James Paul McCartney was born on June 18, 1942, in Liverpool, England, to Mary and James McCartney. His mother was a maternity nurse,
    and his father a cotton salesman and jazz pianist with a local band. The young McCartney was raised in a traditional working-class family,
    much the same as his future fellow Beatles Ringo Starr and George Harrison. Tragically, when McCartney was only 14 years old, his mother
    died of complications after a mastectomy. His future bandmate, John Lennon, also lost his mother at a young age—a connection that would
    create a close bond between the two musicians.</p>
