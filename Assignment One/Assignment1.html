<strong>A web page</strong> (also written as webpage) is a <em>document</em> that is suitable to act as a web resource on the World Wide Web. In order to graphically display a web page, a web browser is needed. This is a type of software that can retrieve web pages from the Internet. When accessed by a web browser it may be displayed as a web page on a monitor or mobile device. Typical web pages are hypertext documents which contain hyperlinks, often referred to as [1]links, for browsing to other web pages.
The term web page usually refers to what is visible, but may also refer to the contents of the source code itself, which is usually a text file containing hypertext written in HTML or a comparable markup language. Most current web browsers include the ability to view the source code. Web browsers will frequently have to access multiple web resource elements, such as style sheets, scripts, and images, while presenting each web page.
A website will typically contain a group of web pages that are linked together, or have some other coherent method of navigation. The most important web page on a website is the index page. Depending on the web server settings, the index page can have any name, but the most common names are index.html and index.php. When a browser visits the homepage of a website or any URL pointing to a directory rather than a specific file, the web server serves the index page. If no index page is defined in the configuration or no such file exists on the server, either an error or directory listing will be served to the browser.
Websites and the web pages that comprise them are usually found with assistance from a search engine, but they can receive traffic from social media and other sources. On a network, a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remote web server. The web browser uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to make such requests to the web server. The web server may restrict access to a private network (for example, a corporate intranet).
A static web page is delivered exactly as stored, as web content in the web server's file system. In contrast, a dynamic web page is generated by a web application, driven by server-side software, running on the client-side (on the web browser), or both. Dynamic web pages help the browser (the client) to enhance the web page through user input to the server.

Browsers and other web Technologies[edit]
Main article: Web browser
A web browser can have a graphical user interface, like Internet Explorer / Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera, or can be text-based, like Lynx or Links.
Web users with disabilities often use assistive technologies and adaptive strategies to access web pages.[1] Users may be color-blind, may or may not want to use a mouse perhaps due to repetitive stress injury or motor neuron problems, may be deaf and require audio to be captioned, may be blind and using a screen reader or braille display, may need screen magnification, etc.
Disabled and able-bodied users may disable the download and viewing of images and other media, to save time, network bandwidth or merely to simplify their browsing experience. Users of mobile devices often have restricted displays and bandwidth. Anyone may prefer not to use the fonts, font sizes, styles and color schemes selected by the web page designer and may apply their own CSS styling to the page. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) recommend that web pages are designed with all of these options in mind.
Elements[edit]
A web page, as an information set, can contain numerous types of information, which is able to be seen, heard or interacted with by the end user:
Perceived (rendered) information:
Textual information: with diverse render variations.
Non-textual information:
Static images may be raster graphics, typically JPEG, GIF, or PNG; or vector formats such as SVG or Flash.
Animated images typically Animated GIF and SVG, but also Flash, Shockwave, or Java applet.
Audio, typically MP3, Ogg or various proprietary formats.
Video, WMV (Windows), RM (RealMedia), FLV (Flash Video), MPG, MOV (QuickTime)
Interactive information: see interactive media.
For "on page" interaction:
Interactive text: see DHTML.
Interactive illustrations: ranging from "click to play" images to games, typically using script orchestration, Flash, Java applets, SVG, or Shockwave.
Buttons: forms providing an alternative interface, typically for use with script orchestration and DHTML.
For "between pages" interaction:
Hyperlinks: standard "change page" reactivity.
Forms: providing more interaction with the server and server-side databases.
Internal (hidden) information:
Comments
Linked Files through Hyperlink (Like DOC, XLS, PDF, etc.)
Metadata with semantic meta-information, Charset information, Document Type Definition (DTD), etc.
Diagrammatic and style information: information about rendered items (like image size attributes) and visual specifications, as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).
Scripts, usually JavaScript, complement interactivity, and functionality.
Note: on server-side the web page may also have "Processing Instruction Information Items".
The web page can contain dynamically adapted information elements, dependent upon the rendering browser or end-user location (through the use of IP address tracking and/or "cookie" information).
From a more general/wide point of view, some information (grouped) elements, like a navigation bar, are uniform for all website pages, like a standard. This kind of "website standard information" are supplied by technologies like web template systems.
Static and dynamic[edit]
Main article: static web page
A static web page (sometimes called a flat page or a stationary page) is a web page that is delivered to the user's web browser exactly as stored,[2] in contrast to dynamic web pages which are generated by a web application.[3]

A static web page is delivered to the user exactly as stored.
Consequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a web server to negotiate content-type or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so.
To create a web page, a text editor or a specialized HTML editor is needed. In order to upload the created web page to a web server, an FTP client is traditionally used.
The design of a web page is highly personal. A design can be made according to one's own preference in as much detail as one wishes. Alternatively, a pre-made web template can be used. Web templates let web page designers edit the content of a web page without having to worry about the overall aesthetics. Many use all-in-one services for web domain purchases, web hosting service and templates to build customized websites. Web publishing tools such as Tripod and Wordpress offer free page creation and hosting up to a certain size limit. Other ways of making a web page are to download specialized software, like a Wiki, CMS, or forum. These options allow for the quick and easy creation of a web page which is typically dynamic.
Main article: Dynamic web page
A server-side dynamic web page is a web page whose construction is controlled by an application server processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, parameters determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.
A client-side dynamic web page processes the web page using HTML scripting running in the browser as it loads. JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the Document Object Model, or DOM, that represents the loaded web page. The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way.
A dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a computer program to change some variable content. The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a dynamic web page update using Ajax technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the web browsing history forward of the displayed page. Using Ajax technologies the end user gets one dynamic page managed as a single page in the web browser while the actual web content rendered on that page can vary. The Ajax engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, the DOM, for its client, from an application server.
DHTML is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not static web pages, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of AJAX, a term which is now itself rarely used. Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.
Features[edit]
</p>
<p>
<strong>Color, typography, illustration</strong>
<em>Web pages</em> usually include information such as the colors of text and backgrounds and very often contain links to images and other types of media to be included in the final view. Layout, typographic and color-scheme information is provided by Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) instructions, which can either be embedded in the HTML or can be provided by a separate file, which is referenced from within the HTML.
The latter case is especially relevant where one lengthy stylesheet is relevant to a whole website: due to the way HTTP works, the browser may only download it once from the web server and use the cached copy for the whole site.
Images are stored on the web server as separate files, but again HTTP allows for the fact that once a web page is downloaded to a browser, it is quite likely that related files such as images and stylesheets will be requested as it is processed. An HTTP 1.1 web server will maintain a connection with the browser until all related resources have been requested and provided. Web browsers usually render images along with the text and other material on the displayed web page.
Scrolling[edit]
<strong>Web pages</strong> will often require more screen space than is available for a particular display resolution.
Most modern browsers will place a scrollbar (a sliding tool at the side of the screen that allows the user to move the page up or down, or side-to-side) in the window to allow the user to see all content.
