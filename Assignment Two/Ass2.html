<h1><a name="poem"> Our Deepest Fear </a></h1>

<p> Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
<br />
<br />
Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
<br />
<br />
It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us.
<br />
<br />
We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous,
<br />
<br />
talented and fabulous?
<br />
<br />
Actually, who are you not to be?
<br />
<br />
You are a child of God.
<br />
<br />
Your playing small does not serve the world.
<br />
<br />
There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other
<br />
<br />
people won't feel insecure around you.
<br />
<br />
We were born to make manifest the glory of
<br />
<br />
God that is within us.
<br />
<br />
It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone.
<br />
<br />
And as we let our own light shine,
<br />
<br />
we unconsciously give other people
<br />
<br />
permission to do the same.
<br />
<br />
As we are liberated from our own fear,
<br />
<br />
Our presence automatically liberates others.
<br />
<br />
